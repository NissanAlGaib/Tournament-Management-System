## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL database
- Composer (PHP dependency manager)
- SMTP email server access (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd "c:\xampp\htdocs\GitHub Repos\Tournament-Management-System"
composer install
```

This installs PHPMailer for email functionality.

### Step 2: Database Migration

Run the SQL migration to add new columns:

```bash
mysql -u root -p tournament_management < backend/database/add_registration_fields.sql
```

Or execute via phpMyAdmin/MySQL Workbench.

### Step 3: Email Configuration

1. Copy the example config:
```bash
cp backend/config/email_config.example.php backend/config/email_config.php
```

2. Edit `backend/config/email_config.php` with your SMTP credentials:

```php
'smtp' => [
    'host' => 'smtp.gmail.com',
    'port' => 587,
    'username' => 'your-email@gmail.com',
    'password' => 'your-app-password',  // Gmail App Password
    'encryption' => 'tls',
],
```

**Gmail Setup:**
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
2. Generate App Password: [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
3. Use the 16-character app password

### Step 4: Update Application URL

In `email_config.php`, set your app URL:
```php
'app_url' => 'http://localhost/Tournament-Management-System',
```

    'debug' => true,  // Shows SMTP conversation in error log
]
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

**Check SMTP Credentials**
```php
// Verify in email_config.php
'username' => 'correct-email@gmail.com',
'password' => 'correct-app-password',
```

**Enable Debug Mode**
```php
'settings' => [
    'debug' => true,
]
```

**Check Error Logs**
- Location: `C:\xampp\apache\logs\error.log`
- Look for PHPMailer errors

**Test SMTP Independently**
Create `test-email.php` in project root:
```php
<?php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
require_once 'backend/api/database.php';
require_once 'backend/classes/EmailNotification.class.php';

$database = new Database();
$db = $database->getConnection();
$email = new EmailNotification($db);

$result = $email->sendRegistrationSubmitted(
    'your-email@example.com',
    'Test User',
    'Test Tournament',
    1
);

echo $result ? "✅ Email sent successfully!" : "❌ Email failed to send";
```

### Database Issues

**Verify Columns Exist**
```sql
DESCRIBE tournament_participants;
```

Should show: `phone_number`, `experience_level`, `player_role`, `additional_info`

**Re-run Migration**
```bash
mysql -u root -p tournament_management < backend/database/add_registration_fields.sql
```

### Permission Errors

Ensure organizer has correct permissions:
- Must be tournament creator OR
- Must have Admin role

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Production Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```php
   'username' => $_ENV['SMTP_USERNAME'],
   'password' => $_ENV['SMTP_PASSWORD'],
   ```

2. **Never Commit Credentials**
   - `email_config.php` is in `.gitignore`
   - Use `email_config.example.php` as template

3. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs sanitized
   - HTML escaped in emails
   - SQL parameterized queries

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Consider limiting registration attempts
   - Prevent email spam abuse

5. **HTTPS Required**
   - Use SSL/TLS in production
   - Secure email transmission

## 📊 Database Schema

### New Columns in `tournament_participants`

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `phone_number` | VARCHAR(20) | Player contact number |
| `experience_level` | ENUM | beginner, intermediate, advanced, professional |
| `player_role` | VARCHAR(50) | Preferred position/role |
| `additional_info` | TEXT | Extra player information |

### Existing Registration Status

```sql
ENUM('pending', 'confirmed', 'waitlist', 'rejected', 'withdrawn')
DEFAULT 'pending'
```

---

## 🎨 Email Templates

All email templates are responsive HTML located in:
`backend/templates/emails/`

### Customization

Edit templates to match your branding:
- Colors and gradients
- Logo placement
- Content and messaging
- Links and CTAs

Templates use PHP for dynamic content:
```php
<?php echo htmlspecialchars($userName); ?>
<?php echo htmlspecialchars($tournamentName); ?>
```
